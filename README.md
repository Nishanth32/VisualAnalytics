# VisualAnalytics
A project on Visual Analytics involving Machine learning predictions

Project Website can be accessed through the Prototype built on Azure: http://visualanalytics.azurewebsites.net/Dashboard.html

Our motivation was to help the communities understand the issue of debris and to visualize the work done so far since the inception of the Bahamas plastic movement. We discovered better ways to visualize the project on debris collection and clean up rate around the world, by providing insight through visual analytics and providing a platform that could help make insightful decisions about the predictive cleanup rate along the debris rate to reduce debris in the world.

The Bahamas Plastic Movement is a nonprofit environmental organization committed to raising awareness and finding solutions to plastic pollution locally in The Bahamas and globally. Within the bigger frame of debris analysis and debris movement prediction, from Bahamas Plastic Movement. The debris items collected vary in size. Hence, for each beach, debris collection is partitioned into transects and quadrats. Large debris items (macro debris items) are collected in 25 meter long transects, while small debris items (micro debris items) are collected in quadrats. With this data, our job was to visualize it in a way that makes it easy to understand the distribution of the debris on the beaches. To do so, we have decided that visualizing the data in SVG format would be the best way for this. Hence, we have used D3.js, a JavaScript library for visualizing data

FUTURE WORK

Implementation of Analytics on the Movement of Floating Marine Debris Visualization and Analysis is built on the data that is collected from a variety of different sources. Since the consolidated data used as a part of our project defines a data structure template with all the necessary attributes and property that can be used extensively for future analysis on different system. We aimed to kick start a development in building an Application Programming Interface (API) with public endpoints to read and write to our database. We also have plans for helping basic users or small organization with a dedicated interface to download data or template and upload new data through the template will be a good solution to address the problem like data redundancies that we have faced during the initial phase of consolidating data from multiple source
